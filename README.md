# MyFirstGame
I wrote this game in 2017 using python and pygame, it was my first huge project.



I am not finished this game because of my school. It has endless mode and story mode, for endless mode enter "ok" in console.

You can use my spritesheets for free, however i would like to receive some info about way you are using it.
